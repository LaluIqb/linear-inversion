# linear-inversion

Inversion modeling is basically the process of modifying the model (model parameters, **m**) in order to obtain a fit solution with the observed or calculated data (**d**). Thus, why this method is often referred to as data fitting. Linear inversion represents the linearity between **m** and **d** as shown as d = G.m where G the kernel matrix.
